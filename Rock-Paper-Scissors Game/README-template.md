### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

**All "states" of the game in one HTML document** 
- Using javascript to add/remove .hidden class, to show the correct elements for that "state"
```html
<p class="hidden">YOU PICKED</p>
<p class="hidden">THE HOUSE PICKED</p>
<div class="result hidden">
  <p data-result>YOU LOSE</p>
  <button>PLAY AGAIN</button>
</div>
```
```css
.hidden {
    display: none;
}
```

**CSS only Modal**
- Display modal when you click on the div with the anchor tag using css :target
```css
#modal:target {
    display: block;
}
```

**Window matchMedia() Method**
```js
//function to check viewport size
function checkViewportOver960px(x) {
    if (x.matches) { // If media query matches
        playGround.style.maxWidth = "520px";
        play2.style.alignSelf = "flex-end";
        play3.style.alignSelf = "flex-end";
    } else {
        playGround.style.maxWidth = "360px";
        play2.style.alignSelf = "flex-start";
        play3.style.alignSelf = "flex-start";
    }
}
```
